throught this we can store 2 digits in a single byte
we will declare 2 variables, a and b in byte(shortest datatype)
1st digit  will occupy 4 bits from total 8 bites and get stored into "a" variable
2nd digit  will occupy 4 bits from total 8 bites and get stored into "b" variable
we will right shift the value of variable a 4 times. a = (a<<4) 
then we will get the value of (a|b) aORb. then because of the truth table of OR it will give
the value of a and b (a in first 4 bits ) (b in next 4 bite)
4bits+4bits=1 byte(smallest datatype)
the we will print and see the result.
